# Insurance Policy Q&A Agent

AI agent for answering insurance policy questions, built with Agentic Star.

> **Category**: Cat 2 (domain-specific RAG Q&A pipeline)
> **Industry**: Insurance
> **Template ID**: INS-C2-001

## Overview

Retrieval-augmented Q&A agent over an insurer's policy document knowledge base. Insurance agents, customer-service representatives, claims adjusters, or policyholders ask natural-language questions about policy terms, coverage limits, exclusions, claim conditions, and rider terms; the agent retrieves the relevant policy clauses from an indexed knowledge base and returns a plain-language answer with numbered source citations and a mandatory advisory disclaimer (reference information only — binding interpretations must be confirmed against the actual policy contract). Retrieval and answer assembly are deterministic in this version: a keyword-scoring retriever over a seeded JSON knowledge base and a rule-based answer composer, with a documented upgrade seam for vector search and LLM synthesis.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent fails
during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/` for the design and the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
